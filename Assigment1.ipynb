For example, to run the code in a cell, select it and then click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-play\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Cell -> Run`** menu item. Similarly, to copy a cell, select it and then click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-copy icon-copy\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Edit -> Copy`** menu item. With this simple pattern, it should be possible to perform nearly every action with the mouse.\n",

When they are rendered, a nice formatted representation of the cell's contents will be presented. When they are unrendered, the raw text source of the cell will be presented. To render the selected cell with the mouse, click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-play\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Cell -> Run`** menu item.
